# Experiment 2: DDL Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DDL commands and different types of constraints.

## THEORY

### 1. CREATE
Used to create a new relation (table).

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE (
  field_1 data_type(size),
  field_2 data_type(size),
  ...
);
```
### 2. ALTER
Used to add, modify, drop, or rename fields in an existing relation.
(a) ADD
```sql
ALTER TABLE std ADD (Address CHAR(10));
```
(b) MODIFY
```sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name MODIFY (field_1 new_data_type(size));
```
(c) DROP
```sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name DROP COLUMN field_name;
```
(d) RENAME
```sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name RENAME COLUMN old_field_name TO new_field_name;
```
### 3. DROP TABLE
Used to permanently delete the structure and data of a table.
```sql
DROP TABLE relation_name;
```
### 4. RENAME
Used to rename an existing database object.
```sql
RENAME TABLE old_relation_name TO new_relation_name;
```
### CONSTRAINTS
Constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted by the constraint. It can be specified when the table is created (using CREATE TABLE) or after it is created (using ALTER TABLE).
### 1. NOT NULL
When a column is defined as NOT NULL, it becomes mandatory to enter a value in that column.
Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) NOT NULL
);
```
### 2. UNIQUE
Ensures that values in a column are unique.
Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) UNIQUE
);
```
### 3. CHECK
Specifies a condition that each row must satisfy.
Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) CHECK (logical_expression)
);
```
### 4. PRIMARY KEY
Used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
Properties:
Must contain unique values.
Cannot be null.
Should contain minimal fields.
Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) PRIMARY KEY
);
```
### 5. FOREIGN KEY
Used to reference the primary key of another table.
Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size),
  FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table(column)
);
```
### 6. DEFAULT
Used to insert a default value into a column if no value is specified.

Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  col_name1 data_type,
  col_name2 data_type,
  col_name3 data_type DEFAULT 'default_value'
);
```

**Question 1**
--
```
 Create a new table named orders with the following specifications:
    ord_id as TEXT with a length of 4.
    item_id as TEXT.
    ord_date as DATE.
    ord_qty as INTEGER.
    cost as INTEGER.
    The primary key is a composite key consisting of item_id and ord_date.
    ord_id and item_id should not accept NULL
```



```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  ord_id CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
  item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  ord_date DATE,
  ord_qty INTEGER,
  cost INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (item_id, ord_date)
);
```

**Question 2**
---
```
In the Products table, insert a record where some fields are NULL, another record where all fields are filled without any NULL values, and a third record where some fields are filled, and others are left as NULL.

ProductID   Name              Category    Price       Stock
----------  ---------------   ----------  ----------  ----------
106         Fitness Tracker   Wearables
107         Laptop            Electronics  999.99      50
108         Wireless Earbuds  Accessories              100

```

```sql
-- insert into Products (ProductID,Name,Category,Price,Stock) values('106','Fitness Tracker','Wearables',null,null),('107','Laptop','Electronics','999.99','50'),
('108','Wireless Earbuds','Accessories',null,'100');
```

**Question 3**
---
```
create a table named jobs including columns job_id, job_title, min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value for job_title is blank and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be entered automatically at the time of insertion if no value assigned for the specified columns.
```

```sql
create table jobs(
  job_id text primary key,
  job_title text default '',
  min_salary integer default 8000,
  max_salary integer default null
 
);
```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
```
Write an SQL query to add two new columns, department_id and manager_id, to the table employee with datatype of INTEGER. The manager_id column should have a default value of NULL.
```

```sql
alter table employee add department_id INTEGER;
alter table employee add manager_id INTEGER default NULL;

```
